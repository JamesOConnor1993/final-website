    	    <td width="764"><p>Jon Snow's parentage remains a mystery. He is believed to have been born towards the end of Robert's Rebellion, within one month, give or take, of the Sack of King's Landing. Returning from the war, Lord Eddard Stark brought the new born babe to Winterfell, insisting on raising him with the rest of his family.</p>
   	        <p>Jon has an older half-brother Robb, two younger half-sisters Sansa and Arya, and two younger half-brothers Bran and Rickeon. His presence at Winterfell turned to be a source of friction between Eddard and his wife, Catelyn, who saw Jon's presence as a constant reminder of her husband's infidelity, she treats him coldly making him feel unwelcome. His appearance, resembling Eddard more closely than any of his true born siblings, strains the relationship between himself and Catelyn further. However, Eddard always treated Jon the same as his trueborn children and Jon got on well with his half-siblings, particularly with Robb and Arya.</p></td>
