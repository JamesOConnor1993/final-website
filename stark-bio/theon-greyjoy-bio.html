    	    <td><p>Theon was a young boy of ten, when his father's rebellion was crushed and his two brothers were killed, making him the heir to House Greyjoy and the Iron Islands. He was taken as a hostage and ward by Lord Eddard Stark and has been raised at Winterfell for nine years since. He was raised with the Stark children and tutored along with them in all disciplines. His relationship with the Starks was respectful, while he considered Robb Stark a close friend and brother. He feuded, however, with Jon Snow, the other outsider of the family. Theon sought approval from the Starks, but usually felt unsatisfied. He is a skilled bowman.</p>
   	        <p>Theon is known for his arrogance and his cocky smile. He is a lean, dark, handsome youth of 19 years</p></td>
