    	    <td width="765"><p>Catelyn is the eldest daughter of <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Minisa_Whent" title="Minisa Whent">Lady Minisa</a> and <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hoster_Tully" title="Hoster Tully">Lord Hoster</a> Tully, head of <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Tully" title="House Tully">House Tully</a>, Lord Paramount of the <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Riverlands" title="Riverlands">Riverlands</a>. She has a younger brother,<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Edmure_Tully" title="Edmure Tully">Edmure</a>, and a younger sister, <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lysa_Tully" title="Lysa Tully">Lysa</a>.</p>
    	      <p>She spent her childhood in <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Riverrun" title="Riverrun">Riverrun</a>, where she befriended her father's ward, <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Petyr_Baelish" title="Petyr Baelish">Petyr Baelish</a>. Although the ward fell in love with and sought her hand, Catelyn never shared his feelings, seeing him as a little brother, but no more. When she was twelve, it was announced that she was betrothed to <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brandon_Stark" title="Brandon Stark">Brandon Stark</a>, heir of Winterfell, in what would strengthen the ties of friendship between the great houses. When Brandon came to Riverrun to meet with Catelyn, young Petyr challenged him to a duel for her hand. Brandon won handily, but spared Baelish's life in compliance with Catelyn's plea,. Baelish was banished from Riverrun back to his own home as soon as he was sufficiently recovered; he later sent a single letter after Brandon's death, but she burned it without reading it.</p>
    	      <p>Catelyn's betrothal with Brandon ended abruptly when he, along with his father, was killed by the <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II" title="Aerys II">Mad King</a>, setting off <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert%27s_Rebellion" title="Robert's Rebellion">Robert's Rebellion</a>, led by his younger brother <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Eddard Stark</a> and his childhood friend <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert_Baratheon" title="Robert Baratheon">Robert Baratheon</a>. During the Rebellion Catelyn father sought to continue the alliance and she ended up marrying Eddard. She moved to Winterfell, where she and Eddard have formed a strong and loving marriage, and they are well respected and loved by nobles and smallfolk alike. Catelyn and Eddard have five children: <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb</a>, <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sansa_Stark" title="Sansa Stark">Sansa</a>, <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya</a>, <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran</a> and <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rickon_Stark" title="Rickon Stark">Rickon</a> and have raised Eddard's bastard son <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Snow" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a>, which was the single act of faithlessness that was a source of friction between her and her husband.</p>
