    	    <td width="765"><p>Catelyn is the eldest daughter of Lady Minisa and Lord Hoster Tully, head of House Tully, Lord Paramount of the Riverlands. She has a younger brother, Edmure, and a younger sister, Lysa.</p>
    	      <p>She spent her childhood in Riverrun, where she befriended her father's ward, Petyr Baelish. Although the ward fell in love with and sought her hand, Catelyn never shared his feelings, seeing him as a little brother, but no more. When she was twelve, it was announced that she was betrothed to Brandon Stark, heir of Winterfell, in what would strengthen the ties of friendship between the great houses. When Brandon came to Riverrun to meet with Catelyn, young Petyr challenged him to a duel for her hand. Brandon won handily, but spared Baelish's life in compliance with Catelyn's plea,. Baelish was banished from Riverrun back to his own home as soon as he was sufficiently recovered; he later sent a single letter after Brandon's death, but she burned it without reading it.</p>
    	      <p>Catelyn's betrothal with Brandon ended abruptly when he, along with his father, was killed by the Mad King, setting off Robert's Rebellion, led by his younger brother Eddard Stark and his childhood friend Robert Baratheon. During the Rebellion Catelyn father sought to continue the alliance and she ended up marrying Eddard. She moved to Winterfell, where she and Eddard have formed a strong and loving marriage, and they are well respected and loved by nobles and smallfolk alike. Catelyn and Eddard have five children: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon and have raised Eddard's bastard son Jon Snow, which was the single act of faithlessness that was a source of friction between her and her husband.</p>
