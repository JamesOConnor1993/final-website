    	    <td><p>Robb was born in Riverrun, presumably the product of  Eddard and Catelyn's wedding night,  Eddard raced off to war immediately following the nuptials to fight in Robert's Rebellion. Upon his return from the war, Catelyn greeted Ned with an infant Robb, and all returned to Winterfell, where Ned would rule as Lord and Robb was to be raised as his heir.</p>
   	        <p>Growing up in Winterfell, Robb was on good terms with his younger siblings, and developed a friendly rivalry with his bastard half-brother, Jon Snow, who differs from Robb in appearance and personality. Robb was also close with his father's ward, Theon Greyjoy, who came to regard Robb as something of a younger brother.</p>
   	        <p>Later on, Robb became known as King in the North.</p></td>
