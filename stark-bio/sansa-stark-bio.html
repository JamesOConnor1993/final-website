    	    <td><p>Sansa is the eldest daughter and second child of <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Catelyn_Stark" title="Catelyn Stark">Lady Catelyn</a> and <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark" title="Eddard Stark">Lord Eddard</a> Stark, head of <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Stark" title="House Stark">House Stark</a> and <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Warden_of_The_North" title="Warden of The North">Warden</a> of the <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/North" title="North">North</a>. She was born and raised at <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell" title="Winterfell">Winterfell</a>. In her eleven years, she learns the duties of a noble daughter and is tutored by septa <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mordane" title="Mordane">Mordane</a> in the traditional womanly arts. Sansa has a younger sister <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya</a>. She has an older brother, <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robb_Stark" title="Robb Stark">Robb</a>, and two younger brothers, <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bran_Stark" title="Bran Stark">Bran</a> and <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rickon_Stark" title="Rickon Stark">Rickon</a>. She has a bastard half-brother, <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Snow" title="Jon Snow">Jon Snow</a>.</p>
   	        <p>Sansa is traditionally beautiful, taking after her mother's family (<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Tully" title="House Tully">the Tullys</a>) with her high cheekbones, vivid blue eyes and thick auburn hair. She is eleven years old at the start of the series. As she has grown up, her figure has been described as tall, graceful and womanly.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sansa_Stark#cite_note-Ragot7.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-0">[1]</a></p>
   	        <p>Sansa was raised a lady, and possesses the traditional feminine graces of her milieu, with a keen interest in music, poetry, singing, dancing, embroidery, and other traditional feminine activities. Like many girls her age, Sansa is enthralled by songs and stories of romance and adventure, particularly those depicting handsome princes, honorable <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight" title="Knight">knights</a>, chivalry, and love.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sansa_Stark#cite_note-Ragot7.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-0">[1]</a> Initially those song and stories were Sansa's vision of the world beyond Winterfell, a world she desperately wishes to experience, but she was later disabused of such innocent romanticized notions.</p>
   	        <p>Sansa's relationship with her sister <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arya_Stark" title="Arya Stark">Arya</a> is often strained, and the two are opposites in most respects. She was briefly accompanied by a <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Direwolf" title="Direwolf">direwolf</a> pup named <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lady_(direwolf)" title="Lady (direwolf)">Lady</a>. She is fond of lemoncakes.</p></td>
