    	      <p>George R. R. Martin was born on September 20, 1948, in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonne,_New_Jersey" title="Bayonne, New Jersey">Bayonne, New Jersey</a>, the son of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevedore" title="Stevedore">longshoreman</a>&nbsp;Raymond Collins Martin and his wife Margaret Brady Martin who also had two daughters, sisters Darleen and Janet. The family lived in a federal housing project near to the Bayonne docks. Being poor, the young Martin lived in his imagination and began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he finally decided they were killing each other off in &quot;sinister plots.&quot; Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and then later&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_High_School_(New_Jersey)" title="Marist High School (New Jersey)">Marist High School</a>. While there he became an avid comic book fan, developing a strong interest in the innovative superheroes being published by&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a>. &nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four" title="Fantastic Four">Fantastic Four</a></em>&nbsp;No. 20 (Nov 1963) printed a letter Martin wrote to the editor, the first of many sent from his family's home at 35 E. First Street, Bayonne, NJ. Other fans wrote him letters, and through such contacts Martin joined the fledgling comics&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom" title="Fandom">fandom</a>&nbsp;of the era, writing fiction for various&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanzines" title="Fanzines">fanzines</a>.&nbsp;In 1965 Martin won comic fandom's&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley_Award" title="Alley Award">Alley Award</a>&nbsp;for his prose superhero story &quot;Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier,&quot; the first of many awards he would go on to win for his fiction.<br />
   	            In 1970 Martin earned a B. S. in Journalism from&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University" title="Northwestern University">Northwestern University</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanston,_Illinois" title="Evanston, Illinois">Evanston, Illinois</a>, graduating&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_cum_laude" title="Summa cum laude">summa cum laude</a></em>; he went on to complete his M. S. in Journalism in 1971, also from Northwestern. Eligible for the draft during the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, to which he objected, Martin applied for and obtained&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector" title="Conscientious objector">conscientious objector</a>&nbsp;status;&nbsp;he instead did alternative service work for two years (1972â€“1974) as a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteers_in_Service_to_America" title="Volunteers in Service to America">VISTA</a>&nbsp;volunteer, attached to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County" title="Cook County">Cook County</a>&nbsp;Legal Assistance Foundation. He also directed chess tournaments for the Continental Chess Association from 1973 to 1976. Then from 1976 to 1978 he was an English and journalism instructor at Clarke University (then Clarke College) in Dubuque, IA, becoming Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.<br />
   	            Martin began selling science fiction&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_stories" title="Short stories">short stories</a>&nbsp;professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first story, &quot;The Hero&quot;, sold to&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Science_Fiction" title="Galaxy Science Fiction">Galaxy</a></em>&nbsp;magazine and was published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. The first story of his nominated for the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award" title="Hugo Award">Hugo Award</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_Award" title="Nebula Award">Nebula Award</a>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_Morning_Comes_Mistfall" title="With Morning Comes Mistfall">With Morning Comes Mistfall</a></em>, published in 1973 by&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact" title="Analog Science Fiction and Fact">Analog</a></em>&nbsp;magazine. A member of the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy_Writers_of_America" title="Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America">Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America</a>&nbsp;(SFWA), Martin became the organization's Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979; from 1996 to 1998 he served as its vice president.<br />
   	            In 1976, for Kansas City's&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MidAmeriCon" title="MidAmeriCon">MidAmeriCon</a>, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldcon" title="Worldcon">Worldcon</a>), Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardner_Dozois" title="Gardner Dozois">Gardner Dozois</a>&nbsp;conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers, their friends, and family the evening following the convention's Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but ultimately wound up losing both awards, for the novelette &quot;...and Seven Times Never Kill Man&quot; and the novella&nbsp;<em>The Storms of Windhaven</em>, co-written with&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Tuttle" title="Lisa Tuttle">Lisa Tuttle</a>. The Hugo Losers Party became an annual Worldcon event thereafter, its formal title eventually evolving into something a little more politically correct as both its size and prestige grew.<br />
   	            Although much of his work is fantasy or horror, a number of his earlier works are science fiction occurring in a loosely defined&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_history" title="Future history">future history</a>, known informally as &quot;The Thousand Worlds&quot; or &quot;The Manrealm&quot;. He has also written at least one piece of political-military fiction, &quot;Night of the Vampyres&quot;, collected in&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Turtledove" title="Harry Turtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s anthology&nbsp;<em>The Best Military Science Fiction of the 20th Century</em>. <br />
   	            The unexpected commercial failure of Martin's fourth book,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Armageddon_Rag" title="The Armageddon Rag">The Armageddon Rag</a></em>&nbsp;(1983), &quot;essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time&quot;, he recalled. It began his career in television, however, as a result of a Hollywood option on that novel that then led to him being hired, first as a staff writer and then as an Executive Story Consultant, for the revival of the&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_(1985_TV_series)" title="The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)">Twilight Zone</a></em>. When the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a>&nbsp;series ran its course, Martin and other&nbsp;<em>Twilight Zone</em>&nbsp;staff writers migrated over to the already underway satirical science fiction series&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_(TV_series)" title="Max Headroom (TV series)"><em>Max Headroom</em></a>. While there he wrote scripts and created the show's Ped Xing character, the president of the Zic Zak corporation, Network 23's primary sponsor. Before his completed scripts could go into production, the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>&nbsp;show was canceled in the middle of its second season. Martin then became a producer on the dramatic fantasy series&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(1987_TV_series)" title="Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)">Beauty and the Beast</a></em>; in 1989 he became the show's co-supervising producer. During this same period, he also worked in print media as a book series editor, overseeing the development of the lengthy and still on-going&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Cards" title="Wild Cards">Wild Cards</a></em>&nbsp;series, which takes place in a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_universe" title="Shared universe">shared universe</a>&nbsp;in which a small slice of postâ€“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>&nbsp;humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus. In&nbsp;<em>Second Person</em>&nbsp;Martin &quot;gives a personal account of the close-knit&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game" title="Role-playing game">role-playing game</a>&nbsp;(RPG) culture that gave rise to his&nbsp;<em>Wild Cards</em>&nbsp;shared-world anthologies&quot;.&nbsp;Martin's own contributions to the multiple-author series often feature Thomas Tudbury, &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_and_Powerful_Turtle" title="The Great and Powerful Turtle">The Great and Powerful Turtle</a>&quot;, a powerful&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinetic" title="Psychokinetic">psychokinetic</a>&nbsp;whose flying &quot;shell&quot; consisted of an armored <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VW_Beetle" title="VW Beetle">VW Beetle</a>. As of June 2011, 21&nbsp;<em>Wild Cards</em>&nbsp;volumes had been published in the series; earlier that same year, Martin signed the contract for the 22nd volume, <em>Low Ball</em>, which has since been completed and will be published by&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_Books" title="Tor Books">Tor Books</a>&nbsp;in mid-summer of 2014. In early 2012 Martin signed another Tor contract for the 23rd&nbsp;<em>Wild Cards</em>&nbsp;volume,&nbsp;<em>High Stakes</em>.<br />
            Martin's novella,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightflyers" title="Nightflyers">Nightflyers</a></em>, was adapted into a 1987 feature film of the same title; he was not happy about having to cut plot elements for the screenplay's scenario in order to accommodate the film's small budget. In 1991 Martin briefly returned to writing novels and began what would eventually turn into his epic fantasy series&nbsp;<em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, which will be seven volumes. The first&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones" title="A Game of Thrones">A Game of Thrones</a></em>&nbsp;was published in 1996. In November 2005&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Feast_for_Crows" title="A Feast for Crows">A Feast for Crows</a></em>, the fourth novel in this series, became&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></em>&nbsp;No. 1 Bestseller and also achieved No. 1 ranking on&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>&nbsp;bestseller list. In addition, in September 2006,&nbsp;<em>A Feast for Crows</em>&nbsp;was nominated for both a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quill_Award" title="Quill Award">Quill Award</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Fantasy_Award" title="British Fantasy Award">British Fantasy Award</a>. The fifth book,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dance_with_Dragons" title="A Dance with Dragons">A Dance with Dragons</a></em>, was published in July 2011, quickly becoming a huge international bestseller, including a No. 1 ranking on the New York Times Bestseller List and many others; it remained on the NY Times list for more than a year. The series has received critical praise from authors, readers, and critics alike. In 2012&nbsp;<em>A Dance With Dragons </em>made the final ballot for science fiction and fantasy's Hugo Award, World Fantasy Award, Locus Poll Award, and the British Fantasy Award; the novel went on to win the Locus Poll Award for Best Fantasy Novel.</p>
