    	    <td><p>Winterfell is a huge castle complex spanning several acres, consisting of two massive walls and a village located just outside called the &quot;winter town&quot;.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Racok50.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-1">[2]</a> Winterfell itself has been built around an ancient <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Godswood" title="Godswood">godswood</a> and over natural hot springs. The water is piped through walls and chambers to heat them, making Winterfell more comfortable than other castles during the harsh northern winter.</p>
    	      <p>Inside the walls, the complex is composed of dozens of courtyards and small open spaces. Weapons training and practice take place in those yards. The inner ward is a second, much older open space in the castle where archery practice takes place. It is located next to the broken tower. Inside Winterfell stands the Inner Castle, which contains the Great Keep and the Great Hall.</p>

    	      <ul>
    	        <li><strong>The Great Keep</strong>, is the innermost castle and stronghold of the castle complex.

    	      <ul>
    	        <li><strong>The Great Hall</strong>, used for receiving guests and the place where the household would dine together, including the lord of the house. The Great Hall is very large, on the outside it's enclosed with grey stone and covered with banners, with wide doors made of oak and iron, which opens to the castle yard, whilst a rear exit leads to a dimly-lit gallery. Inside it can hold eight long rows of trestle tables, four to each side of the central aisle, that can seat 500 people. There is a raised platform for noble guests.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot5.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-5">[6]</a> The ceiling of the Great Hall collapsed during the Sack of Winterfell.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Racok69.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-6">[7]</a></li>

                  <li><strong>The First Keep</strong>, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress. It is no longer in use. Around it lies a lichyard where the Kings of Winter would lay their loyal servants. <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lady_(direwolf)" title="Lady (direwolf)">Lady</a> is buried there.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot53.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-8">[9]</a> The keep has gargoyles atop it.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot66.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-9">[10]</a> During the <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sack_of_Winterfell" title="Sack of Winterfell">Sack of Winterfell</a>, one whole side of the building collapsed.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Racok69.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-6">[7]</a></li>

    	        <li><strong>Broken Tower</strong>, also known as the Burned Tower, it was once the tallest watchtower in Winterfell, but over 140 years ago a lightning strike set it afire and the top third collapsed inward, and no one bothered to rebuild it<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot8.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-10">[11]</a><a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Racok35.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-11">[12]</a> It stands behind the old inner ward.</li>

At the center of the grove stands an ancient <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Weirwood" title="Weirwood">weirwood</a> with a face carved into it, standing over a pool of black water.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot2.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-7">[8]</a> Across the godswood from the heart tree, beneath the windows of the <em>Guest House</em>, an underground hot spring feeds three small pools, with a moss covered wall looming above them. The godswood is enclosed by walls, and is accessed by a main iron gate, or smaller wooden ones.</li>

    	      <ul>
    	        <li><strong>Glass Garden</strong>, the Glass Garden is a greenhouse heated by the hot springs, turning the Glass Garden into a place of moist warmth.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot6.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-2">[3]</a> It is used to grow fruits, vegetables and flowers.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot7.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-4">[5]</a><a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Racok51.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-12">[13]</a></li>

It's long and narrow, with pillars moving two by two along its length. Between pillars stand the sepulchers of the Starks of Winterfell, the likenesses of the dead seated on thrones, with iron swords set before them to keep the restless spirits from wandering, and snarling direwolves at their feet. The crypts are located deep under the earth, cavernous and bigger than the complex above ground. They are accessed by a twisting stone stair and a huge <a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ironwood" title="Ironwood">ironwood</a> door that lies at a slant to the floor. The stair continues below to older levels where the most ancient Kings in the North are entombed.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot4.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-13">[14]</a><a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot66.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-9">[10]</a><a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Racok69.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-6">[7]</a></li>

    	      <p>Winterfell is a huge castle complex spanning several acres, defended by two massive granite walls with a wide moat between them. The outer wall is 80 feet high, the inner is 100 feet high, with a wide moat between them. There are guard turrets on the outer wall and more than thirty watch turrets on the crenelated inner walls.</p>
    	      <p>The main gatehouse is made of two huge crenelated bulwarks, flanking the arched gate and drawbridge that opens into the market square. There are three additional gates, the Hunter's Gate directly on the opposite side of the castle and south/northern gates. There is a narrow tunnel inside of the inner wall stretching halfway around the castle, allowing travel from the south gate all the way to the northern gate without interruption.</p>
    	      <ul>
    	        <li><strong>Hunter's Gate</strong>, the Hunter's Gate is a gate that is located close to the kennels and the kitchens. It opens directly onto the open fields and the Wolfswood, so people can come and go without having to cross through the winter town.

Its market square is filled with wooden stalls for merchants, its streets are muddy and lined with rows of houses made from log and undressed stone. Less than one in five were occupied during the summer, but they would fill up once winter arrived.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot37.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-17">[18]</a> The Kingsroad sits beyond the winter town, which would put it to the east of Winterfell.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot13.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-18">[19]</a> There is an inn in the winter town.<a href="http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Winterfell#cite_note-Ragot24.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-19">[20]</a></p></td>
